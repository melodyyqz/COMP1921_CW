Generally I will complete testing by inputting erroneous data, boundary data to check that the correct output is displayed, which should be an error message alongside an error code being returned. I will also check that the memory is freed when functions fail where relevant.

I will also enter the expected inputs to check that the function does what it should and exhibits the correct behaviour. For example, the argCheck function should take only the correct number of arguments and return an error message and error code otherwise.
