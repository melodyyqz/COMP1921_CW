first things first:
- make another file, called fileHandlingTest.c, pklace everythiong but checkMN in there
- start thorughouly debugging checkMN.
- make sure it atleast prints out the correct magic number for the file given
- make sure it works with all files provided, even w/ header files.

fileHandlingTest.c is to store the code I have
will be checking fileHandling.c which will hold the functions I am currently testing
