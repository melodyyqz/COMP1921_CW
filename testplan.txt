The argCheck function should take 3 arguments and returns an error message and error code otherwise. I will check the first 2 characters of the file are "P2" in the magicNumber function, else it will return an error message and error code. When a NULL comment is read, the file is closed, an error message is output and an error code is returned. Also, I will check that if the width, height, and grays are not within the bounds, an error message will be output and an error code will be returned.

I will also check that if the malloc function or the pointer for efficient read code fails then an error message is printed and an error code is returned.  If the file failed to open, then there should be an error message output and an error code returned. Finally, the magic number, dimensions and gray values should be correctly entered or there will be an error message output and error code returned.
