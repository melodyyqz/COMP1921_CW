I will check that the argCheck function takes three arguments and returns an error message and error code otherwise. I will also check that the first two characters of the file are the characters "P2" in the magicNumber function, else it will return an error message and error code. I will test that when NULL comment is read, the file is closed, an error message is output and an error code is returned. For the whg function, I will check that if the width, height, and grays are not within the image dimension bounds, an error message will be output and an error code will be returned.

I will also check that if the malloc function or the pointer for efficient read code fails then an error message is printed and an error code is returned.  If the file failed to open, then there should be an error message output and an error code returned. Finally, the magic number, dimensions and gray values should be correctly entered or there will be an error message output and error code returned.
